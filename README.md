### Game "Even or Odd"

**Description:**

The **"Even or Odd"** game challenges you to determine whether a given number is even or odd. When the game starts, you will be greeted and prompted to answer a series of questions. In each round, a random integer will be displayed, and you must respond with `"yes"` if the number is even or `"no"` if it is odd.

**Objective:**

Correctly identify the parity of the numbers presented to win the game.

**How to Play:**

- The game presents a random number.
- You decide if the number is even:
  - If even, type `yes`.
  - If odd, type `no`.
- Repeat for all rounds to complete the game.

**Skills Developed:**

- Quick decision-making
- Mental arithmetic
- Understanding of even and odd numbers

### Game "Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)"

**Description:**

The **"Greatest Common Divisor"** game tests your ability to find the largest number that divides two given numbers without leaving a remainder. In each round, you are presented with two random positive integers. Your task is to calculate and provide their greatest common divisor.

**Objective:**

Correctly compute the GCD of each pair of numbers to successfully complete the game.

**How to Play:**

- Two numbers are displayed (e.g., `48 18`).
- Determine the greatest common divisor of the numbers.
- Enter the GCD as your answer.
- Proceed through all rounds with correct answers.

**Skills Developed:**

- Understanding of factors and divisibility
- Basic number theory concepts
- Analytical thinking

### Game "Arithmetic Progression"

**Description:**

In the **"Arithmetic Progression"** game, you are presented with a sequence of numbers forming an arithmetic progression with one missing element. An arithmetic progression is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference to the preceding term. Your task is to identify and provide the missing number in the sequence.

**Objective:**

Accurately find the missing number in each arithmetic progression to win the game.

**How to Play:**

- A progression is displayed with a missing number (e.g., `5 7 9 .. 13`).
- Analyze the sequence to determine the pattern.
- Calculate the missing number.
- Enter the missing number.
- Complete all rounds successfully.

**Skills Developed:**

- Pattern recognition
- Sequential reasoning
- Mathematical analysis

### Game "Is It a Prime Number?"

**Description:**

The **"Is It a Prime Number?"** game challenges you to determine whether a given number is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. In each round, a random number is displayed, and you must answer `"yes"` if the number is prime or `"no"` if it is not.

**Objective:**

Correctly identify the primality of each number to complete the game successfully.

**How to Play:**

- A number is presented (e.g., `17`).
- Decide if the number is prime:
  - If prime, type `yes`.
  - If not prime, type `no`.
- Continue through all rounds without errors.

**Skills Developed:**

- Knowledge of prime numbers
- Divisibility rules
- Critical thinking and analysis
